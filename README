This is a collection of scripts that will scrape popular web comic sites and will combine the links to the
comic image into a single xml file that can be put into an RSS Reader like google reader.

REQUIREMENTS:
There are two python libraries required to run this script. One
that is used to help with parsing the html, and one that generates
the rss xml.

	HTML Parsing: 
		Mechanize: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/
		To include in this script, either run the python setup.p install script
		or just manually add the mechanize/ directory in the src/ directory
		below so that it can be included automatically by Python

	RSS Xml generation: 
		PyRSS2Gen: http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html
		This is a single python file that again be inclued via the setup.py script,
		or just manually copy the file into the src directory to be included by Python
